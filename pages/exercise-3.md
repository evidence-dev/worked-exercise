# Exercise 3: Templated Pages

Templated pages allow you to generate many pages from a single markdown file.

Each page has a different URL, but the same structure. The URL you use determines which content is displayed.

## a. Create a `queries` folder

_Exercise: Create a `queries` folder in the root of your project._

This stores queries that you can access in all your markdown files. Each file is named `query_name.sql`.

## b. Write a query returning one row for each pages you want to create

_Exercise: Write a query and save it in the `/queries` folder._

## c. Run the `Evidence: Create Templated Page from Query` command

_Exercise: Write a query and save it in the `/queries` folder._

This scaffolds out a new folder for you with an index page, and a templated page. Once you've made it, go to the index page and test the links in the table.

## d. Customize the Content on your Templated Page

_Exercise: Add a metric or measure for the specific entity the page represents._
